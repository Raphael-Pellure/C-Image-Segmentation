# C-Image-Segmentation
Project developed during my first year of Master's at ENSEEIHT, focusing on image segmentation using K-means and Mean-Shift algorithms. The goal was to implement and compare these clustering techniques for texture-based image segmentation, evaluating their performance with ground truth metrics.
